#### Using
1. Make sure your `line in` you plug your guitar works correctly.

2. In the `settings.ini` file, specify the sample rate of your audio card, and the index of the input channel. The index of the input channel is defined in index.exe.

3. If desired, you can change the values `FRAME_SIZE`, `FRAMES_PER_FFT`. The lower the value of these two parameters, the lower the latency, but the worse the stability.

4. Then just run `Controller.exe` or `controller.py`!

5. If you want to tune your guitar, then run tuner.exe😂
